# lmi: the KernelSU-Next manager here is preinstalled as a /product system
# app, signed with its own dedicated cert (device/xiaomi/lmi/security/
# ksu_manager/) rather than default_dev_cert -- a shared default_dev_cert
# collides with other resigned /product apps and lets the kernel's manager
# scan crown the wrong app entirely (CONFIRMED 2026-08-30 on crosshatch,
# see crosshatch-ksu-manager-product-app-bugs memory). Same keystore
# identity as the other devices; see ~/ksu-manager-build/README.md.
# Computed via: apksigner verify --print-certs + manual v2 signing-block
# cert extraction.
